### Fig 1 – Visualization of theoretical 3D perimeter distance (PD) measurements

A hypothetical example is shown in which the distance-based colocalization of a
blue fluorescent object relative to red fluorescent objects is assessed. 12 
perimeter voxels (illustrated as light-blue boxes) have been identified for the
blue object. The numbers in the centre of each perimeter-voxel refer to PD 
measurements: the shortest distance from the perimeter-voxel to the nearest red 
fluorescent signal. The mean and median of all of these PD measurements gives 
the PD<sub>mean</sub> and PD<sub>median</sub> metrics respectively. The largest
and smallest of these PD measurements gives the PD<sub>max</sub> and 
PD<sub>min</sub>(“edge-edge”) distances respectively.
