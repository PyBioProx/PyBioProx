# Overall tasklist - Jeremy

* Overall ease of use
  * Creating folders as needed
  * Simple file selection interface
* Batch processing - kind of already does this (on current folder)
  * Potentially create collated output - e.g. excel spreadsheet with data from all datasets
  * Could be done by adding in an analysis submodule that collates exising csv files
* Collated analysis
  * Get e.g. all mean distances (from all objects across all datasets in a condition) into a single "column" that can then be easily manipulated
* Add in extensibility options - e.g. adding different preprocessing etc, outputs. 

# Competition - Josh

* Diana - imagej plugin 
  * main advantage is batch interface
  * gives number of contacts instead of "raw distances"
  * speed - diana batch macro taking days to run (~100 images), ours takes ~ hour or less for 100 images or less
